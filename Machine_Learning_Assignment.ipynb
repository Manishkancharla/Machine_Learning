        "A) Handling Categorical Variables in Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Categorical variables, which represent groups or categories rather than numerical values, cannot be directly used in many machine learning algorithms. These algorithms often require numerical inputs. To overcome this, several techniques are employed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. One-Hot Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept: Creates new binary features for each category within a variable. A \"1\" is assigned to the present category, and \"0\" to the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If the variable \"Color\" has categories \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" and \"Green,\" one-hot encoding would create three new features: \"Color_Red,\" \"Color_Blue,\" and \"Color_Green.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages: Simple to implement, preserves information about the categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages: Can increase the number of features significantly, especially with many categories, potentially leading to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Label Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept: Assigns a unique integer to each category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If the variable \"Size\" has categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" label encoding might assign 0 to \"Small,\" 1 to \"Medium,\" and 2 to \"Large.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages: Reduces the number of features compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages: Introduces an artificial order among the categories, which may not be meaningful. This can be problematic for some algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept: Similar to label encoding, but only applicable to ordinal categorical variables (where categories have a natural order).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For the \"Education Level\" variable with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" and \"Master's,\" ordinal encoding would assign 0 to \"High School,\" 1 to \"Bachelor's,\" and 2 to \"Master's.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages: Preserves the order of the categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages: Requires ordinal categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Target Encoding (Mean Encoding):\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept: Replaces each category with the mean (or other statistics) of the target variable for that category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If the target variable is \"Income\" and the categorical variable is \"City,\" each city would be replaced with the average income of people living in that city.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages: Captures the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
